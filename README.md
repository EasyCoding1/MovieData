Movie Data for FAC


Finished the project so moved it into this file. 

Not really happy with my performance here as while I produced all the code myself I was pretty much following guides and copying the whole time. 

If I have time I may revisit this to try again without so much help but may not be possible. 

It was difficult to even know where to begin with adding content. I knew how to generate the cards with createElement. and append.child etc but it was a bit much for me. 

So in conclusion, project complete but not happy with it and definitely could not recreate with extensive googling and copying etc
